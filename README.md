# **📌 Cracking the DSA Coding Interviews**  
🚀 *A complete guide to mastering DSA for coding interviews*  

## **📖 Introduction**  
👋 Hi, I'm **Abhisekh Nayek!**  

I come from a farmer's family, and I’ve always been passionate about technology. Despite my background, I worked my way up to becoming a **Software Engineer at Jobcode**. My journey has been full of challenges, but through **consistency, problem-solving, and a love for coding**, I’ve managed to grow my skills and help others do the same.  

This repository is my way of **giving back**—helping fellow programmers crack **DSA rounds** with a **structured and practical** approach.

## **🗂️ Repository Overview**  
🔹 Categorized list of **DSA problems** with solutions  
🔹 **Brute Force → Better → Optimal** approaches for each problem  
🔹 **"Do’s and Don’ts"** for coding interviews  
🔹 **What to do when you're stuck** in a problem  
🔹 **Essential Coding Interview Patterns** to recognize problem-solving techniques

## **📌 Golden Rules for Coding Interviews**  
### ✅ **Do’s**  
✔ Stay **Positive & Confident**  
✔ **Ask Clarifying Questions** before jumping in  
✔ **Think Aloud & Collaborate** during the interview  
✔ Start with a **Brute Force** approach, then optimize  
✔ **Admit when you don’t know something** and think logically  

### ❌ **Don’ts**  
✖ **Don’t jump straight to code**—plan first!  
✖ **Don’t assume**—always ask!  
✖ Avoid **jargon** without explanation  
✖ Never **skip communication**—explain your thought process  
✖ **Don’t be defensive about feedback**—learn and adapt

## **💡 What to Do When Stuck?**  
🔹 Explain where you're stuck to the interviewer  
🔹 Break the problem into **smaller** steps  
🔹 Identify known **patterns** (Sliding Window, Two Pointers, etc.)  
🔹 Ask for hints if needed—interviews are **interactive!**
